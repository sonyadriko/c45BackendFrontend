<h2>Background</h2>
Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) are essential for monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities and potential threats. The C4.5 algorithm is a decision tree-based classifier that is effective for categorizing different types of network threats. By implementing this algorithm in a web-based application, this project aims to provide a user-friendly platform for detecting and classifying network intrusions.
<h2>Key Features</h2>
Threat Classification: Uses the C4.5 algorithm to classify network traffic into different threat categories.
Data Management: Allows users to upload and manage network traffic data for analysis.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time monitoring and detection of network intrusions.
Visualization: Offers visualization of classification results and network traffic data.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive web interface for managing and viewing network intrusion data.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
PHP 8: Used for application logic and server-side processing.
MySQL: Used for storing network traffic data and classification results.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for developing the user interface.
Bootstrap: Used for responsive design and layout.
